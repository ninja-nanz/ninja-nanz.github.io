      <h3> What are three new things you have learned about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning? </h3>
      <p>I learnt a few things about myself, such as:</p>
      
      <p>1. I tend to want to jump ahead and zoom through my learning rather than take time to understand the concepts. I need to slow my mind down. </p>
      <p>2. Learning a new thing like programming is humbling as there is so much I don’t know and need to accept I will have a beginner's mindset.</p>
      <p>3. When listening to people I want to jump in and solve their problems </p>
      
      <br>
      <h3> What has surprised you the most about the core learning? </h3>
      <p> The concepts and skills are not only to our professional lives, but also our personal lives. What surprised me is how little we learn about it in traditional educational environments. </p>
      <br>
      <h3> What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning? </h3>
      <p> It was challenging to practice mindfulness everyday. </p>
      <br>
      <h3>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course?</h3>
      <p>Programming in companies is collaborative effort. Core skills help us become better collaborators and are just as important as technical skills in the modern day workforce. </p>
      
      <br>
      
      <h3>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practicing programming instead? Justify your answer. </3>
      <p> No, learning core has helped me learn better. I would have liked to have more time to code, but in the long run learning about neuroplasticity, emotional intelligence and growth mindset has helped me build resilience to face the ups and downs in my  journey of learning programming. </p>

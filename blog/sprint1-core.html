    <p>In this exploration, I gathered evidence from my coworkers to understand my strenghts and weaknesses. I then answered the following questions</p>
    <br>
    <h3>Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made and the consequences of the action you took.
    </h3>
    <p> I was being put on a project that didn't feel like the right fit for resourcing. As a result, I told a director of a company who was happy that I had informed him about this. However, in doing do I had overstepped the new project manager who was not in favour of this decision. I strongly felt that my decision was the right one. But upon hearing that the project manager felt disrespected by me, I apologised to him in an email because I feel being right is less important if it means the relationship with the people you are working it is damaged. Being accomodating and respectful is a core personal value.</h3>> 
    </p>
<br>
    <h3>Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity.
    </h3>
    <p>Being an Indian immigrant with highly educated parents, I place a lot of value on hardwork and education in order to progress. Other aspects of my culture are respecting elders, being family-oriented, being self-sufficient, being of service. In my early twenties I joined Enspiral - a non-hierarchical collective in Wellington where I learned many of my values around collaboration, participation, group-decision making, bringing your whole self to work etc 
    </p>

   <h3>Evaluate your strengths and limitations in terms of your learning and career development
    </h3>
    <p>My strenghts lie in being a quick learner, creative and collaboration, openness, and understanding deeper context. My limitations revolves around time management, overworking and organisation. I often get too passionate about my deriving my identity from work that I struggle to say no and end up living unhealthily by overworking. 
    </p>
<br>
    <h3>Identify which of your strengths might help you in your learning journey and how they might intersect with learning obstacles.
    </h3> 
    <p>Being able to think outside the box, being open and the drive to understand problems will help me through my learning process. 
    </p>
<br>
    <h3>Share an example from your experience of where you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss the strategies you used at that time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now, and why.
    </h3>
    <p> When a very experienced designer joined my workplace, we struggled to work well together because there was no established hierarchy. I'm more experienced in flat-hierarchies. But in this case, the new designer needed to be heard and respected for their experience. I took me awhile to realise this. I tried a few things such as listening more, taking time to understand her point of view, taking the opportunity to learn from her rather than think I knew all the answers. Asking for advice and being open to be coached vastly improved our rapport. Looking back, what I would should have done is taken her out for meal and learnt about her experience as a designer in the industry, and done a reality check on my own experiences alongside.

<p> I’ve gotten a feel for a few of my habits when I’m presented a challenging problem. My go to technique for problem solving is to just try something based on my current knowledge. If that doesn’t work then, I read the error message to decipher what went wrong OR to understand the problem better. If it is a bug or bad syntax I look up the correct syntax or method and try run my solution again. Often the next step is to jump on google and type in the problem I’m experiencing different ways until I get what I want. This usually leads me to stackoverflow or MDN or youtube to learn more. </p>
<p> With FizzBuzz – I was really stuck. I didn’t know where to start. It was pretty overwhelming. Luckily I was in the EDA space and was able to ask a fellow cohorter where to begin. He told me about the modulo % function. This not only helped me with this particular problem, but helped me understand more about math operators and how they work in code. </p>
<p> Having learnt the built-in methods before doing the ‘Gradebook’ kata, I was able to deploy an elegant solution to find the grade average by using the reduce() function divided by the length of the grades array. It felt amazing to figure that one out quickly. </p>

<p> What I’ve learn about problem solving is that it’s worth trying it on your own for a few tries but to stop when you are not progressing. It’s worth getting help from external resources because you are able to move quickly through and build on your previous mistakes. I’ve noticed breaking down the problem comes natural to me and I tend to skip the pseudocode because I rubber duck the problem before I start. </p>

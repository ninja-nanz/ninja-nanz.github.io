    <p>In this blog post, I explore a few concepts around the DOM, JS and it’s interaction with HTML and CSS. </p>
    <br>
    
    <h2> HTML & CSS & Javascript & DOM– An analogy </h2>
    <p>- If HTML is a train - it has compartments, it has wheels etc <br>
    - CSS is what the train looks like - it’s colour, the interior design, sleek look <br>
    - JS is what makes the train move <br>
    - DOM is the railway tracks!</p>
    
    
    <br>
    
    <h2> Control flow and loops </h2> 
<p>Control flow is a command used in Javascript to tell a computer to execute something in a particular order or way. It basically controls how your program runs. 
    <br>
    <br>
    Loops are a type of control flow. This is a repetitive or iterative function that repeats an action, for example - do something multiple times for a certain number of times. There are different types of loops with have different conditions and exceptions such as “for” and “while” loops. 
    <br>
    <br>
    Expanding on the ‘trains’ metaphor to illustrate control flow: 
    <br>// the train will keep running <strong> for </strong> 8 hours only every day
    <br>// <strong> if </strong>it is day time the trains will run, <strong> otherwise (else) </strong> it won’t run 
    <br>// <strong> do</strong> keep the train doors open, <strong> while </strong>passengers are entering the train
</p><br>
    
    <h2> The DOM </h2> 
    <p>The DOM or Document Object Model is a programming interface that helps the browser interact with objects in an HTML document. The DOM is structured like a tree that holds all the objects such as head, body, title etc. The tree structure is hierarchical and the different objects have a single parents. 
    <br><br>
    The DOM can be accessed using DevTools on the Chrome browser. With the DOM you can manipulate what you see on the website. It is also a great tool or testing and debugging your code. 
</p>
<br>
    <h2> Arrays and Objects </h2> 
<p>Arrays and Objects are ways of storing data in Javascript. 
    <strong> Arrays </strong> is an ordered list of things. The order is an important for organising items in an array, that is why items is indexed starting from 0,1, 2 etc. When you want to retrieve a particular item, you have to call the position the item is in, eg: If you want the 3rd item = array[2]. 
    
    An arrays look like: 
    </p>
    <div class="code-block"> arr = [ item1, item 2, item 3 ]</div>
    
    <p><strong> Objects </strong> is a collection of different properties. The organisation structure uses keys and values. The order of the properties doesn’t matter when wanting to access an item. You can get an item based on it’s key. Eg: object[‘name’] or object.name.
    
    
    An object looks like: </p>
    
    <div class="code-block"> obj = {
    <br>name: Nanz,
    <br>location: Wellington
    <br>};
    </div>
   <p> Arrays and Objects can be used in combination with each other or themselves in order to access different data combinations. 
</p> 
<br>
    <h2> Functions </h2> 
   <p>Functions are instructions for a specific task or a set of tasks. For example, below the function returns the sum of ‘a’ and ‘b’. 
    </p> 
    <div class="code-block"> function doTask(a, b) {
    <br>task = a + b
    <br>return task
    <br>}
    </div>
    
   <p>You can look at functions as a recipe that you put together with parameters (ingredients). 
    <br>
    Functions are useful make something happen on the app when you input data!

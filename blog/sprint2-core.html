    <p>It's time to create to my learning plan for how I want to learn coding and human skills at Enspiral DevAcademy. To start of with, here are my strength and limitations: </p>
    <br>
    <div id="left-col"><h2>Strengths</h2>
        <p>Creativity and lateral thinking </p>
        <p>Openness and responsive to feedback </p>
        <p>Quick learner </p>
    </div>

    <div id="right-col"><h2>Limitations</h2>
        <p>Time management </p>
        <p>Saying 'No'</p>
        <p>Prefectionism</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Workload and Team Management</h2>
    <p>I'm commited to prioritising my learning inspite of having other things going on my life for the next 100 days. I am to keep my inner critic in-check when I hit blockers while learning or while in a team situation. I'm also going to aim to get things done rather than have them done perfectly. I also aim to have clear and transparent communication with my facilitators and peers so they know what I'm dealing with with regards to my workload and capacity. </p>

    <br>

    <h2>Seeking help</h2>
    <p>As someone who is introverted, I tend to keep issues to myself OR try and solve my own problems. I recognise that this is not always healthy and will aim to seek help if things are getting too overwhelming. On a technical side, I will aim to try and solve blockers for 20mins max before seeking external help. </p>

    <br>

    <h2>My facilitators</h2>
    <p>I see my facilitators as coaches who will help me grow and accelerate my learning during DevAcademy. I expect them to push me to my best ability, while also recognising if there are things that are stopping me from achieving my goals. I also see them as my accountability-buddy who I checkin with at a regular cadence to keep me progressing. <p>

    <br>

    <h2>My learning schedule</h2>
    <p>I take a few moments at the end of each sprint to identify how I can be more efficient with my learning and delivery. At the start of the sprint I skim through the curriculum and plot out the hours needed to learn the content. I then map this onto a weekly calendar alongside my other commitments. While learning coding is my priority for the next 3.5 months, I also have to progress other aspects such as university interviews and potential career opportunities. I aim to code/learn 6 days of the week with a flexible schedule during Foundations. The reason for flexibility is to get other life tasks finished and out of the way before I start bootcamp in Mid-march.
